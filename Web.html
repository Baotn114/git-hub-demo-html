            - "Safe & Sound" is a song by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift featuring 
            alternative country duo the Civil Wars, taken from The Hunger Games: 
            Songs from District 12 and Beyond, the official soundtrack for the 2012 
            film The Hunger Games. The artists co-wrote the track with its producer, T-Bone Burnett; 
            the song was written at Burnett's house within two hours.

            [2] The song was critically lauded, with critics praising Swift's breathy vocals, the simplicity of 
            the music, and its lyrics, with some citing it as a welcome return to form for Swift.
